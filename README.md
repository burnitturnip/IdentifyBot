# IdentifyBot

A Discord bot that can classify images using TensorFlow.
I followed the [TensorFlow image classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) to create this.

To use, create a folder called 'Data' and create folders within for each class you want. (For example, a folder for cats and a folder for dogs). Fill each folder with appropriate images.
Then, run main.py and the program will train itself using the provided data.
The discord bot can then be activated by typing '!identify' and attaching an image.
